### Branch naming

- master: just the README and the isntallation instructions
- test-1 ([code](https://github.com/NoriSte/feti-workshop-e2e-testing-with-puppeteer/blob/test-1/test/test-1.e2e.test.js#L22)): write a test that passes if the main button takes the user to the linked page
- test-2: it's the same of test-1... but with a damper cookie footer to be accepted
- test-3: the cookie footer now disappear with a CSS animation
- test-4: the cookie footer trigger an event when it's hidden
- test-5-step1 ([code](https://github.com/NoriSte/feti-workshop-e2e-testing-with-puppeteer/blob/test-5-step1/test/test-5.e2e.test.js#L35)): add a Todo in the Vue app and check that it's showed in page
- test-5-step2 ([code](https://github.com/NoriSte/feti-workshop-e2e-testing-with-puppeteer/blob/test-5-step2/test/test-5.e2e.test.js#L62)): ad and remove some Todos and then check the state of the store of the Vue app
- test-6 ([code](https://github.com/NoriSte/feti-workshop-e2e-testing-with-puppeteer/blob/test-6/scrape-google-test-6.js#L28)): scrape the first 30 results of a given query directly by Google

Every test has a working solution in another branch

- test-2-solution ([code](https://github.com/NoriSte/feti-workshop-e2e-testing-with-puppeteer/blob/test-2-solution/test/test-2.e2e.test.js#L24))
- test-3-solution ([code](https://github.com/NoriSte/feti-workshop-e2e-testing-with-puppeteer/blob/test-3-solution/test/test-3.e2e.test.js#L30))
- test-4-solution ([code](https://github.com/NoriSte/feti-workshop-e2e-testing-with-puppeteer/blob/test-4-solution/test/test-4.e2e.test.js#L31))
- test-5-step1-solution ([code](https://github.com/NoriSte/feti-workshop-e2e-testing-with-puppeteer/blob/test-5-step1-solution/test/test-5.e2e.test.js#L39))
