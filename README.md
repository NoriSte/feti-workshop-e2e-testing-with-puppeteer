### Branch naming

- master: just the README and the isntallation instructions
- test-1 ([slide](https://slides.com/noriste/e2e-testing-workshop-feti#/5)): write a test that passes if the main button takes the user to google.com
- test-2 ([slide](https://slides.com/noriste/e2e-testing-workshop-feti#/8)): it's the same of test-1... but with a damper cookie footer to be accepted
- test-3 ([slide](https://slides.com/noriste/e2e-testing-workshop-feti#/9)): the cookie footer now disappear with a CSS animation
- test-4 ([slide](https://slides.com/noriste/e2e-testing-workshop-feti#/12)): the cookie footer trigger an event when it's hidden
- test-5-step1 ([slide](https://slides.com/noriste/e2e-testing-workshop-feti#/15)): add a Todo in the Vue app and check that it's showed in page
- test-5-step2 ([slide](https://slides.com/noriste/e2e-testing-workshop-feti#/16)): ad and remove some Todos and then check the state of the store of the Vue app
- test-6 ([slide](https://slides.com/noriste/e2e-testing-workshop-feti#/21)): scrape the first 30 results of a given query directly by Google

Every test has a working solution in another branch
- test-1-solution ([slide](https://slides.com/noriste/e2e-testing-workshop-feti#/5/1))
- test-2-solution ([slide](https://slides.com/noriste/e2e-testing-workshop-feti#/8/1))
- test-3-solution ([slide](https://slides.com/noriste/e2e-testing-workshop-feti#/9/1))
- test-4-solution ([slide](https://slides.com/noriste/e2e-testing-workshop-feti#/12/1))
- test-5-step1-solution ([slide](https://slides.com/noriste/e2e-testing-workshop-feti#/15/1))
- test-5-step2-solution ([slide](https://slides.com/noriste/e2e-testing-workshop-feti#/16/1))
- test-6-solution ([slide](https://slides.com/noriste/e2e-testing-workshop-feti#/21/1))
- develop: here you can find all the tests and the solutions (remember to ```$ yarn install``` before launching tests because I added the jest-puppeteer package)
